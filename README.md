# daburger

The burger eating application!

## Description

This is a simple full-stack application with front-end HTML and CSS using the Materialze framework, templating from Handlebars.js, a back-end implementation using Node.js, Express, and database support using MySQL.

Users can enter burgers on the menu, making them available for consumption. Adding a burger to the menu also updates the database with the new burger. Available burger entries are shown on the left side of the screen and colored blue. Clicking on a burger consumes it, moving it to the right side of the screen and turning the burger red. The databse is then updated with its new status.
